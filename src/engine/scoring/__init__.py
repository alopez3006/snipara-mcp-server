"""Scoring engine for RLM hybrid search.

This package provides the scoring algorithms for keyword and semantic search:
- Keyword scoring with BM25-style length normalization
- Semantic scoring via embeddings (on-the-fly and pre-computed)
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for hybrid search
- Adaptive weight classification based on query type

Usage:
    from src.engine.scoring import (
        calculate_keyword_score,
        extract_keywords,
        classify_query_weights,
        rrf_fusion,
        hybrid_search,
    )
